#String Literals
'''
Two types of String Literals : single line and multi line

#Numeric Literals
'''
Numerical literals in Python are those literals that contain digits only and are immutable.
Types of Numeric literals:
1)Integer -> octal,binary,decimal,hexadecimal
2)Float  -> fractional,exponential= ((Mantissa)E(exponent))
                                  = exponent - It denotes where the decimal point should be placed.
                                  = mantissa - it denotes the significant digits of the floating-point numbers.

3)Complex
4)Long

#Boolean Literal

#Special literal in python 

'''
Python literals have one special literal known as None.
This literal in Python is used to signify that a particular field is not created.

Python will print None as output when we print the variable with no value assigned to it.
None is also used for end of lists in Python.
'''

x=None
print(x)

#Literal collection 

'''
Types of Literals collection =>

1)List Literals
2)Tuple Literals
3)set
4)dictionary
